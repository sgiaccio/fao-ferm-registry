                        by systematically disseminating good practices resulting
                        from restoration initiatives. This will prevent them
                        from repeating mistakes and will encourage the
                        replication and adaptation of good practices in
                        different contexts with similar goals, enhancing their

                                                were implemented in different

                                                    of loose stones was
                                                    calculated based on the mine
